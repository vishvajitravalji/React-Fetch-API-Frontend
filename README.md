# Frontend Replication with API Fetch - Student Profiles

Completed By: Jason Chi Fai Lee

Built Front-End Focused Web Application by fetching API of Students and replicating design & functions based from Photos.\
Users are able to add Tags to the student and filter search students based on Tag and Full Name.

## Notes

Please note on part 5, I am only able to add the tag into each student after the following steps below.

Steps to add tags are the following:

1) Type into input
2) Press 'Enter'
3) Start typing again on same input box
4) Tag shows up

Note: Unable to figure out how to add tag instantly after a pressing 'Enter', used alternative steps above to solve.
